# **STARK** üöÄ

## DESCRIPTION

Alright, let's cut to the chase. This is **STARK**: the **S**ystematic **T**ext **A**nalysis & **R**esearch **K**it. Think of it as your personal AI research assistant, but cooler, 'cause it lives in your terminal. It fetches, digests, and even visualizes info like a champ, all on your command. Basically, JARVIS-lite for the rest of us. üòâ

## FEATURES ‚ú®

*   **Web Scraping on Demand:** Snags data from across the web (academics, news, forums, you name it) using simple commands. Less clicking, more knowing. üñ±Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏èüß†
*   **NLP Magic:** Chews through text, pulls out the important bits, and builds a slick interactive knowledge graph right in your terminal. Yeah, it's pretty extra.
*   **Swanky Terminal UI:** Forget boring command lines. This thing's got split views, syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and even mouse support for graph spelunking. Built with `prompt_toolkit`, 'cause we're fancy like that.
*   **Chat with Your Data:** Ask questions in plain English and get answers synthesized from the research. It even spots research gaps using topic modeling, lowkey genius. ü§î
*   **Session Savvy:** Saves your progress, remembers citations, and uses smart caching so you're not hitting APIs constantly. Works offline too, mostly. #Resourceful

## LEARNING BENEFITS üßë‚Äçüíª

Building this wasn't just for kicks (okay, maybe a little). You'll get legit hands-on experience with:
*   Crafting complex **T**erminal **U**ser **I**nterfaces that don't suck.
*   Scraping the web without getting blocked (hopefully).
*   Applying **N**atural **L**anguage **P**rocessing tricks (entity recognition, summarization, topic modeling).
*   Making sense of messy info and visualizing it as knowledge graphs in the terminal (it's a vibe).
*   Juggling app state like sessions and caching.
*   Wiring up a bunch of AI/ML bits into one cohesive agent. It's like building your own mini-Avenger, but for research.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED üõ†Ô∏è

The secret sauce includes, but isn't limited to:
*   `prompt_toolkit` (For the slick TUI)
*   `requests` (Go fetch!)
*   `beautifulsoup4` (Making sense of web chaos)
*   `spacy` (or `nltk`) (Brainpower for NLP)
*   `transformers` (Optional upgrade for *big brain* NLP)
*   `scikit-learn` (Classic ML goodness)
*   `networkx` (Drawing pretty graphs)
*   `pandas` (Data wrangling)
*   `argparse` (Handling your commands)
*   `rich` (Optional spice for the TUI)
*   `gensim` (Optional alternative for topic modeling)

## SETUP AND INSTALLATION ‚öôÔ∏è

Easy peasy. Pop open your terminal and:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omdeepb69/stark.git
cd stark
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Boom. Done. You're welcome.

## USAGE ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Just run the main script. If you feel like tinkering, poke around in `config.json`.
```bash
python main.py  # Or however you kick things off
```
Follow the on-screen prompts. It's designed to be intuitive, even I could use it.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE üìÅ

*   `src/`: Where the magic happens (source code).
*   `tests/`: Making sure things don't break (unit tests).
*   `docs/`: The instruction manual (documentation).

## LICENSE üìú

MIT License. Basically, do whatever you want with it, just don't sue me. Play nice.
